          Dr. Danilo V. Ayap and Mr. Alfonso Borda, who shared the same passion
          for Education and Technology, well experience and highly competent
          people founded the Lyceum of Alabang on October 2003 with its original
          name as the National College of Science and Technology or NCST in Km.
          88 GNT Center, Putatan – Muntinlupa City. The Founding of the College
          is marked by a remarkable vision and the abiding faith of the founders
          in the decisive role of education and technology in raising the
          quality of life of the people.
          <br />
          <br />
          Founded as the premier institution in the south, Lyceum of Alabang is
          a non-profit organization dedicated to identifying, preserving, and
          promoting public awareness in Science and Technology. Bustling to be
          globally competitive in Education, Lyceum of Alabang became a part of
          the development of an educational institution in academic, sports,
          cultural, and social responsibility not only to the students but also
          to the whole community of Muntinlupa city.
          <br />
          <br />
          At this point, hearty employees support was shown on the very first
          term of operation, when 580 students enrolled after only 400 had been
          anticipated. The board immediately had to increase in teaching force.
          Two full years of CHED and TESDA programs were offered, including
          BSBA, BSIT, BSCS, BSHRM, HRD, CT, ECT, and ComSec.
          <br />
          <br />
          The industry of the board of trustees in the hectic days of founding
          the school is shown by the fact that several board meetings were held
          in the first year of operation, needless to say were the untiring
          marketing activities of the institution. The board members unselfishly
          sacrificed their time.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another board meeting was held and these gave Dr. Danilo V. Ayap, an
          idea to amend its seC Registration as to the form of ownership of the
          institution. Thus, from being a private corporation to a family-owned
          corporation on April 2004, with Dr. Danilo V. Ayap, as the President
          and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Mrs. Norma M. Ayap, the Vice
          President for Administration and Directress of Basic Education
          Department, Ms. Hazel M. Ayap, as the Vice President for Finance and
          Comptroller, Mr. Fritz Gerard Ayap, the Vice President for Plans and
          Programs, and Ms. Faith Ayap as the Vice President for Technology
          Education Department.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today’s program is, in a way, was splendid to that of 2003, the
          present almost one-hectare land area with new wing building being
          built and still with an ongoing construction of facilities to meet the
          constant growth by the school: Enrolment today – and still on the
          upgrade is 2,800. During the past year the school has also been
          enlarged by being the only assessment center accredited by TESDA in
          the city of Muntinlupa, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Taguig and Pateros
          (MUNTIPARLAS – Lapat District).
          <br />
          <br />
          The new building of Lyceum of Alabang since its transfer on April 2012
          in Km 30 Tunasan, Muntinlupa City, with an outdoor swimming pool
          adjoining, and its recreational ground and covered court give Lyceum
          of Alabang one of the finest school, from every standpoint in the
          entire city of Muntinlupa.
          <br />
          <br />
          Gearing towards global Education, Lyceum of Alabang continue to move
          forward with plans on accreditation level status and develop new
          programs which are marketable and feasible.
